# Maximum-Roaming-Mutli-Task-Learning
This code was made under Pytorch v1.2.0, and is associated to the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09762.pdf.

Each provided folder contains code for its respective dataset (Celeb-A, CityScapes and NYUv2). Inside of these, individual training scripts are provided for each of the baselines described in the submission paper.

For the Celeb-A dataset, we use the official release : http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

For CityScapes and NYUv2, we use the preprocessed data made available here : https://github.com/lorenmt/mtan
